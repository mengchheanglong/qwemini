Project: **Qwemini**  
Tagline: **One workspace for Qwen and Gemini**

Qwemini is an open-source, local-first agent workspace that brings **Qwen CLI** and **Gemini CLI** into one unified environment. The product should feel like a real coding-agent environment, not a thin wrapper around one CLI.

## Read this first

For any significant product, runtime, orchestration, provider, protocol, or state change, read:

1. `README.md`
2. `docs/architecture.md`

If an `implement.md`, `backlog.md`, or other active planning file exists, read that after the architecture doc.

## What this repo is building

Qwemini is building a provider-flexible coding-agent environment with:

- a product-owned shell
- a local daemon as the control center
- provider adapters for Qwen, Gemini, and future engines
- a shared protocol for events, approvals, artifacts, and tool activity
- a shared state layer
- a shared tool / MCP plane
- orchestration above the engine adapters

## Non-goals

Do not drift into these shapes unless the user explicitly decides to change direction:

- not a wrapper around a single provider
- not a VS Code extension first
- not a pure terminal-only product
- not a provider-owned UI
- not orchestration hidden inside provider adapters

## Core architectural rules

1. The UI must not talk directly to provider CLIs. It talks to the daemon.
2. The daemon owns the authoritative run/session/state ledger.
3. Provider-specific behavior belongs behind provider adapters.
4. Orchestration belongs above adapters, not inside them.
5. The top layer must remain provider-agnostic.
6. Plugins must be removable without breaking core product behavior.
7. Tool behavior must be inspectable and governed by explicit approval rules.
8. Important actions should emit normalized events.
9. Resumability and checkpointing are first-class concerns.
10. Avoid backend lock-in in shared packages.

## Working style for Codex

- Prefer small, bounded slices over sweeping rewrites.
- Once the repo has a stable scaffold, prefer bundled loops of 2-3 compatible changes with one validation pass instead of stopping after every micro-step.
- Preserve clear package boundaries.
- When adding a shared abstraction, prove that it is needed by more than one provider or subsystem.
- Do not invent product capabilities that are not in `docs/architecture.md` without updating the docs.
- When architecture changes materially, update `docs/architecture.md` in the same task.
- When repeated operational guidance emerges, update this `AGENTS.md` so the guidance persists.

## Package intent

Use these boundaries unless the repo structure is intentionally changed:

- `apps/` → user-facing shell(s) and daemon app(s)
- `packages/protocol/` → normalized runtime contracts and event schemas
- `packages/state/` → persistence, migrations, checkpoints, archive support
- `packages/providers/` → provider adapters only
- `packages/orchestrator/` → routing, roles, review/verify flows, handoffs
- `packages/mcp-hub/` → shared tool and MCP integration plane
- `packages/plugins/` → optional extensions that can fail without breaking core
- `docs/` → architectural and product truth

## Validation expectations

- Prefer real repo checks over guesswork.
- Do not claim a command passed unless it was actually run.
- Do not invent test/build commands that do not exist yet.
- If scaffolding is incomplete, state what was validated and what is still missing.

## Documentation expectations

- Keep `AGENTS.md` concise and durable.
- Keep detailed architecture in `docs/architecture.md`.
- Keep active task planning in implementation-focused docs, not in `AGENTS.md`.
- If a folder later needs local instructions, add a deeper `AGENTS.md` rather than bloating this root file.

## Current implementation posture

Until the repo says otherwise, treat Qwemini as:

- local-first
- daemon-centered
- provider-flexible
- Qwen-first and Gemini-second for initial adapters
- MCP/tool-pluggable
- orchestration-capable, but with phased rollout
